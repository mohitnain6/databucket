Life Expectancy Predictions project on Machine Learning

Project description-The project tries to create a model based on data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate the life expectancy for different countries in years. The data offers a timeframe from 2000 to 2015. The data originates from here: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/data The output algorithms have been used to test if they can maintain their accuracy in predicting the life expectancy for data they havenâ€™t been trained.


Credit card fraud detection

Project description-The aim of this python project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. i
used a variety of machine learning algorithms that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent one. By the end of this machine learning project, we can analyse the outliers and on previous record of card holders we can predict that they may or may not pay bills.
